== Fuse Service Works / BPM Suite 6 Integration

== Overview
Many enterprise software applications leverage a Business Process Management (BPM) tool.
The BPM solution maintains and manages the state of long-running business processes.
In an enterprise software application that leverages a BPM tool, it is highly recommended that business services continue to be implemented independent of the BPM tool and in adherence to SOA.
In particular, these business services should be course-grained, re-usable, contract-based, stateless and be exposed by standards based protocols.
During the lifecycle of a business process instance, nodes of that process instance should invoke the remote services that encapsulate the business logic.
Correspondingly, these business services should drive the lifecylce of process instances by invoking APIs provided by the BPM tool.

This _xPaaS_ reference architecture demonstrates a _process tier_ and _service tier_ interacting with each-other.
Specifically, a SwitchYard SCA application drives the life-cycle of a BPMN2 process instance whose state is managed remotely by BPM Suite 6.
To do so, the SwitchYard SCA application invokes the REST API of the BPM Suite 6 execution server using the stock RESTEasy composite binding implementation.
The _process tier_ is implemented in a Red Hat Openshift _gear_ provisioned with Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.
The _service tier_ is implemented in a Red Hat Openshift _gear_ provisioned with Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.

== Pre-Requisites
The remainder of this documentation provides instructions for installation, configuration and execution of this reference architecture.
The following is a list of pre-requisites:

. {osetools}
. Openshift Enterprise 2.* environment that has been installed with {rpms} needed to support {cart}.  Contact the Red Hat GPE team for more details.
. medium-sized Openshift Enterprise gear provisioned with {bpmcart} and mysql-5.
. medium-sized Openshift Enterprise gear provisioned with {fswcart} and mysql-5.
. ssh client
. maven 3.0.5 (or greater)
. git client
. familiarity with {bpmproduct}
. familiarity with {fswproduct}
. proficiency with basic *nix command line
. proficiency with vi

As is evidenced by these pre-requisites, the assumed BPM Suite 6 runtime environment for this reference architecture documentation is an Openshift Enterprise gear.
However, BPM Suite 6 and Fuse Service Works can be installed in non-PaaS local environments.
Thus it could be possible to execute this reference architecture in a non-PaaS local environment as well.

== Configuration and Execution
  1)  mvn clean install
  2)  local :   cp -r domain/conf/com $JBOSS_HOME/modules/system/layers/base
    
      remote:   ssh <ssh_url_to_your_openshift_environment> 'mkdir -p app-root/data/appModules'
                scp -r domain/conf/com <ssh_url_to_your_openshift_environment>:~/app-root/data/appModules/
  3)  local :   cp domain/target/domain-1.0.jar $JBOSS_HOME/modules/system/layers/base/com/redhat/gpe/refarch/fsw_bpms_integration/domain/main
      remote:   scp domain/target/domain-1.0.jar    <ssh_url_to_your_openshift_environment>:~/app-root/data/appModules/com/redhat/gpe/refarch/fsw_bpms_integration/domain/main/
  4)  add an explicit dependency on this static module

        ....
        <dependencies>
            <module name="com.redhat.gpe.refarch.fsw_bpms_integration.domain" export="true"/>
        </dependencies
        ...

  5)  bounce the JBoss EAP/BPMS JVM :   ctl_app restart  (select option 1. bpms-6.0)

=== To-Do
* specify role used to query for potential tasks
* demonstrate invocation of the following BPM Suite 6 task operation:  claimnextavailable
* error handling when substitution properties in URL of REST invocation are not valid
** currently rolls back outside of scope of ProcessMgmtBean
** causes multiple invocations of startProcess call)
